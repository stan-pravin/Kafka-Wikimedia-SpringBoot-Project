# Kafka-Wikimedia-SpringBoot-Project

## Description
This project establishes a real-time streaming pipeline that efficiently processes data streams from Wikimedia projects (such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, etc.) using Apache Kafka and Spring Boot. It empowers you to capture, analyze, and react to valuable insights from Wikipedia edit events or other Wikimedia data in a scalable and near real-time manner.

## Key Features
1. Robust Kafka Integration: Leverages Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, to ensure high-throughput, low-latency ingestion and consumption of Wikimedia data streams.
2. Spring Boot Framework: Employs Spring Boot for rapid application development, simplifying project setup, configuration, and dependency management.
3. Scalability and Elasticity: Designed to accommodate growing data volumes and processing demands seamlessly.
4. Flexibility: Tailored to handle various use cases by enabling customization of data processing logic.
5. Additional Features: If your project boasts unique functionalities, enumerate them here (e.g., real-time visualizations, anomaly detection, sentiment analysis).

## Prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
2. Apache Maven 3.x or higher (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
3. A running Kafka cluster (https://kafka.apache.org/)

## Usage
1. Once the application starts, it will continuously listen for data streams from the designated Kafka topics.
2. The processing logic I've implemented will be applied to the ingested data in real-time.
3. Outline specific instructions on how users can interact with the application's output or functionality (e.g., consuming data from a different topic, triggering actions based on processed data).
